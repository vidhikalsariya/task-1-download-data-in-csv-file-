This project provides a REST API built using Flask that downloads stock market OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) using Yahoo Finance, resamples it into custom time intervals, cleans the data, fixes datetime serialization issues, and returns JSON-ready candlestick data.  The API supports any NSE/BSE stock symbol as well as global tickers.
